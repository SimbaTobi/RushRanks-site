    <h1>Child Sexual Abuse & Exploitation (CSAE) Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <time datetime="2025-10-12">October 12, 2025</time></p>

    <h2>Our stance</h2>
    <p>RushRanks has a zero-tolerance policy toward any content that sexually exploits or endangers children. We remove such content, permanently disable accounts, and report apparent child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and/or law enforcement as required by U.S. law.</p>

    <h2>Scope & definitions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Child</strong>: any person under 18 years of age.</li>
      <li><strong>CSAM</strong>: imagery, video, audio, text, or other content that depicts, promotes, solicits, or facilitates sexual abuse or exploitation of a child, including grooming, sexualized nudity of minors, or sexual contact.</li>
      <li><strong>Sexual exploitation</strong>: any attempt to coerce, entice, trade, monetize, or otherwise exploit a minor for sexual purposes (including grooming and sextortion).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prohibited content & conduct</h2>
    <p>The following are strictly prohibited and will result in immediate removal and account action:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Any CSAM or sexualized depictions of minors (real or edited/synthetic).</li>
      <li>Grooming, sexual solicitation of minors, or attempts to obtain sexual images from minors.</li>
      <li>Instructions or offers to trade CSAM; links to CSAM; or attempts to evade detection.</li>
      <li>Sexualized commentary about minors or any content that sexualizes a child’s body.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Detection & moderation</h2>
    <p>We use a combination of user reports, automated tools, and human review to detect potential violations. Automated tools (including <strong>AWS Rekognition</strong> visual moderation) assist with triage. Final enforcement decisions are made by trained human reviewers. Automated signals are not treated as proof on their own.</p>

    <h2>Reporting content to us</h2>
    <p>If you encounter suspected CSAM or grooming on RushRanks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the in-app <strong>Report</strong> button on the video or profile, and select the most accurate reason.</li>
      <li>Or email our Safety team: <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a> with links, timestamps, and any relevant details. Do <em>not</em> download or redistribute the content.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We prioritize CSAE reports and will take appropriate action, which may include removal, account termination, preservation of evidence, and reporting to NCMEC/law enforcement.</p>

    <h2>Our legal obligations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>As a U.S. service provider, when we obtain actual knowledge of apparent CSAM on our service, we will make reports to <strong>NCMEC CyberTipline</strong> pursuant to <strong>18 U.S.C. §2258A</strong>.</li>
      <li>We cooperate with lawful requests from law enforcement, consistent with applicable law and our Privacy Policy.</li>
      <li>We preserve relevant data for investigations and restrict access to the smallest number of trained personnel necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Account actions</h2>
    <p>We may remove content, restrict features, suspend, or permanently disable accounts associated with CSAE. We may also block associated devices, emails, and other identifiers to prevent re-offending. Appeals may be available for non-CSAE enforcement; CSAE decisions are generally final given safety and legal obligations.</p>

    <h2>Minors on RushRanks</h2>
    <p>RushRanks is available only to users aged <strong>13+</strong> in the United States. We prohibit any sexual content involving minors. Parents/guardians and schools are encouraged to discuss online safety with children and teens.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>Safety & reporting: <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a></p>
    <p>For emergencies or imminent harm, contact local law enforcement immediately before notifying RushRanks.</p>
