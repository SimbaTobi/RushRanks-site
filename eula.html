    <h1>End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <time datetime="2025-10-14">October 14, 2025</time></p>

    <p>This End-User License Agreement (“<strong>EULA</strong>”) is between <strong>Sandook LLC</strong> (“<strong>Sandook</strong>,” “we,” “us”) and you and governs your use of the RushRanks mobile applications (the “<strong>App</strong>”). This EULA works with our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>, <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, and <a href="CSAE.html">CSAE Policy</a>; if there’s a conflict, the Terms govern the service/community, and this EULA governs the license to the App.</p>

    <h2>1. License grant</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with this EULA and the Terms, Sandook grants you a <strong>limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable</strong> license to download, install, and run one copy of the App on a device you own or control in the United States for your own non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No copying, modifying, translating, adapting, or creating derivative works of the App.</li>
      <li>No reverse engineering or source extraction except where legally permitted.</li>
      <li>No renting, leasing, selling, sublicensing, distributing, or transferring the App.</li>
      <li>No bypassing or interfering with security or access-control features.</li>
      <li>No bots, scripts, scrapers, or automation to access/interact with the App or rankings.</li>
      <li>No uploading illegal or policy-violating content (including <a href="CSAE.html">CSAE/CSAM</a>).</li>
      <li>No use of the App to build, train, or operate a competing service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ownership</h2>
    <p>The App is licensed, not sold. Sandook and its licensors own all rights in the App. Except for the license granted above, no rights are transferred.</p>

    <h2>4. User content</h2>
    <p>Your uploads and content are governed by the <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. You grant the rights necessary to host, process, display, and distribute your content within RushRanks, including for safety and legal compliance.</p>

    <h2>5. Updates; changes</h2>
    <p>We may provide updates or new versions, which may install automatically. Features may change or be discontinued. This EULA applies to updates unless an update is accompanied by a different license.</p>

    <h2>6. Devices, network, and third parties</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for required devices, OS versions, and data charges. The App may integrate third-party services (ads, analytics, hosting), which are subject to their own terms/policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>This EULA is effective until terminated. It terminates automatically if you breach it or the Terms. We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for safety or legal reasons. Upon termination, stop using the App and delete all copies.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p><strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SANDOOK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SANDOOK WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE APP OR THIS EULA WILL NOT EXCEED <strong>USD $100</strong> OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Sandook harmless from claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your breach of this EULA or misuse of the App.</p>

    <h2>11. Export &amp; sanctions compliance</h2>
    <p>You represent you are not located in, under control of, or a national/resident of any country or party subject to U.S. embargo/sanctions and will not use the App in violation of export/sanctions laws.</p>

    <h2>12. App Store terms (Apple/Google)</h2>
    <p>If you downloaded the App from Apple’s App Store, this EULA is between you and Sandook (not Apple). Apple is a third-party beneficiary and may enforce this EULA. Sandook is responsible for support/maintenance and claims regarding the App. You must also comply with App Store terms. Similar terms apply for Google Play.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing law; venue</h2>
    <p>This EULA is governed by Oregon law (USA), excluding conflict-of-law rules. Exclusive venue is in courts located in <strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>, unless applicable law requires a different forum.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may modify this EULA; material changes will be noticed (e.g., in-app or on our site). Your continued use after the effective date means you agree to the updated EULA.</p>
