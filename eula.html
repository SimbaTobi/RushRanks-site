    <h1>End-User License Agreement (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <time datetime="2025-10-14">October 14, 2025</time></p>

    <p>This End-User License Agreement (“<strong>EULA</strong>”) is between <strong>Sandook LLC</strong> (“<strong>Sandook</strong>,” “we,” “us”) and you (“you,” the “user”) and governs your use of the RushRanks mobile applications and any updates provided by Sandook (the “<strong>App</strong>”). This EULA works together with our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a> and <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If there is a conflict, the Terms govern service/community rules; this EULA governs the software license.</p>

    <h2>1. License grant</h2>
    <p>Subject to your compliance with this EULA and the Terms, Sandook grants you a <strong>limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable</strong> license to download, install, and run one copy of the App on a device you own or control in the United States for your own non-commercial use.</p>

    <h2>2. Restrictions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not copy, modify, translate, adapt, or create derivative works of the App.</li>
      <li>Do not reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code except where legally allowed.</li>
      <li>Do not rent, lease, sell, sublicense, distribute, or transfer the App.</li>
      <li>Do not bypass or interfere with security/access-control features.</li>
      <li>Do not use bots, scripts, scrapers, or automation to access/interact with the App or rankings.</li>
      <li>Do not upload illegal content or content that violates our Terms (including our <a href="CSAE.html">zero-tolerance CSAE policy</a>).</li>
      <li>Do not use the App in violation of applicable law (export/sanctions, age-based regulations).</li>
      <li>Do not use the App to build or train competing services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Ownership</h2>
    <p>The App is <strong>licensed, not sold</strong>. Sandook and its licensors own all rights in the App. Except for the license expressly granted, no rights are transferred.</p>

    <h2>4. User content</h2>
    <p>Your uploads and other content are governed by the <a href="terms.html">Terms of Use</a>. You grant Sandook the rights needed to host, process, display, and distribute your content within RushRanks, including safety review and legal compliance. You remain responsible for your content.</p>

    <h2>5. Updates; changes</h2>
    <p>We may provide updates or new versions, which may automatically install. Features may change or be discontinued. This EULA applies to updates unless an update is accompanied by a different license.</p>

    <h2>6. Devices, network, and third parties</h2>
    <p>You are responsible for devices, OS versions, and data charges. The App may integrate third-party services (ads, analytics, hosting), each subject to their own terms/policies.</p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>This EULA is effective until terminated. It terminates automatically if you breach it or the Terms. We may suspend or terminate access to protect users, the service, or comply with law. Upon termination, stop using the App and delete all copies.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p><strong>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”</strong> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SANDOOK DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE OPERATION.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SANDOOK WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR LOST PROFITS. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE APP OR THIS EULA WILL NOT EXCEED <strong>USD $100</strong> OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE APP IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnity</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Sandook harmless from claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your breach of this EULA or misuse of the App.</p>

    <h2>11. Export & sanctions compliance</h2>
    <p>You represent you are not located in, under control of, or a national/resident of any country or party subject to U.S. embargo/sanctions and will not use the App in violation of export/sanctions laws.</p>

    <h2>12. App Store terms (Apple/Google)</h2>
    <p>If you downloaded the App from Apple’s App Store, this EULA is between you and Sandook (not Apple). Apple is a third-party beneficiary and may enforce this EULA. Sandook (not Apple) handles support/maintenance and claims regarding the App. You must also comply with App Store terms. Similar terms apply for Google Play.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing law; venue</h2>
    <p>This EULA is governed by Oregon law (USA), excluding conflict-of-law rules. Exclusive venue is in courts located in Portland, Oregon, unless applicable law requires another forum.</p>

    <h2>14. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may modify this EULA. If we make material changes, we’ll provide notice (e.g., in-app or on our site). Your continued use after the effective date means you agree to the updated EULA.</p>

    <h2>15. Contact</h2>
