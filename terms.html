  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="small">Last updated: 2025-10-14</p>

  <p class="small">These Terms of Use (“<strong>Terms</strong>”) are a binding agreement between you and <strong>Sandook LLC</strong> (“<strong>RushRanks</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”). By accessing or using the RushRanks mobile apps or website (the “<strong>Service</strong>”), you agree to these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>1) Who may use RushRanks</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Age &amp; location.</strong> The Service is available only in the United States to individuals 13 years or older.</li>
    <li><strong>Parental consent.</strong> If you are 13–17, you affirm you have permission from a parent/guardian and will use the Service under their supervision.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Your account</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Real identity.</strong> You agree to provide accurate information at signup, including your <strong>first and last name</strong>, your <strong>email</strong>, and the <strong>U.S. state</strong> where you live.</li>
    <li><strong>Security.</strong> You’re responsible for your account and for keeping your login secure. Tell us promptly about any unauthorized use.</li>
    <li><strong>One person, one account.</strong> Do not create accounts for others or impersonate anyone.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) The RushRanks experience</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Daily leaderboards.</strong> Upload short videos (“<strong>Rushes</strong>”). State leaderboards reset nightly at <strong>11:59:59 PM Central Time (CT)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Likes‑only scoring.</strong> Ranks are determined by <strong>likes only</strong>. We may remove fraudulent likes or activity at our discretion.</li>
    <li><strong>Local competition, national recognition.</strong> Your Rush competes in the state where you live. We may display national standings or crown a daily national #1.</li>
    <li><strong>Features evolve.</strong> Some features (e.g., public web Rushchive, web share links, comments) may launch later. We may add, change, or remove features at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Content and conduct</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Your content.</strong> You retain ownership of your Rushes and anything you post.</li>
    <li><strong>License to us.</strong> To operate the Service, you grant RushRanks a worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free, sublicensable license to host, store, reproduce, transcode, adapt, publish, perform, display, and distribute your content in connection with the Service (including backups, content delivery, and promotion of the Service). This license ends when your content is deleted from our systems, subject to reasonable archival/backup retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Community rules.</strong> You will not post or do anything illegal, infringing, hateful, harassing, violent, graphic, sexual, dangerous, or otherwise unsafe; that invades privacy; or that attempts to cheat the system (e.g., fake likes, bots, spam, manipulation).</li>
    <li><strong>Moderation.</strong> We may remove or restrict content or accounts to keep the Service safe and fair. We use human review and automated tools (including AWS visual moderation) to help detect potentially unsafe content. We do not use facial recognition to identify people.</li>
    <li><strong>Reports.</strong> Users can report content; we may act on reports at our discretion.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Social links, messaging, and future comments</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Social links.</strong> You may link other social accounts (e.g., TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube) on your RushRanks profile. We display links you provide; we do not pull data from those services unless you explicitly choose to share it.</li>
    <li><strong>Messaging &amp; notifications.</strong> We may enable direct or system messages (e.g., “someone liked your Rush”). See Section 7.</li>
    <li><strong>Comments (future).</strong> If we introduce in‑app comments, you are responsible for what you write. We may remove comments and enforce these Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Advertising and third‑party services</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Ads at launch.</strong> RushRanks shows ads using Google AdMob. We do not offer paid plans or in‑app purchases at launch.</li>
    <li><strong>Third‑party providers.</strong> We rely on service providers for hosting, content delivery/security (CDN), moderation tooling (e.g., AWS), ads (AdMob), push notifications (APNs/FCM), email/support, crash reporting, and diagnostics. Your use of the Service may be subject to their terms and policies where applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Notifications and preferences</h2>
  <p class="small"><strong>Push notifications.</strong> With your permission, we send push notifications (e.g., likes, messages, updates). You can control notifications in your device settings and (where available) in‑app settings.</p>

  <h2>8) Intellectual property</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Ours.</strong> Except for your content and third‑party materials, the Service (including the RushRanks name, logos, graphics, code, and design) is owned by Sandook LLC and protected by law.</li>
    <li><strong>No scraping or reverse engineering.</strong> Do not copy, crawl, scrape, decompile, or attempt to extract source code or data beyond normal use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Copyright complaints (DMCA)</h2>
  <p class="small">If you believe content infringes your copyright, email <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a> with: (a) your contact info; (b) a description of the work; (c) the URL of the allegedly infringing content; (d) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good‑faith belief the use is unauthorized; (e) your electronic signature. We may remove content and, where appropriate, terminate repeat infringers.</p>

  <h2>10) Privacy</h2>
  <p class="small">Your use of the Service is governed by our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains what we collect (including first/last name, email, and your U.S. state), how we use it (likes‑only ranking, moderation, ads, notifications), and your choices/rights.</p>

  <h2>11) Safety measures and integrity</h2>
  <p class="small">We may monitor, analyze, and retain limited technical, security, and moderation logs (including IP addresses processed by us or our providers) to protect the Service, fight fraud, and enforce these Terms. We may throttle or limit activity we deem suspicious.</p>

  <h2>12) Changes, availability, and beta features</h2>
  <p class="small">We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we’ll notify you by reasonable means. We do not guarantee continuous availability. Some features may be released as tests or betas and may change or be removed.</p>

  <h2>13) Termination</h2>
  <p class="small">You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate access, remove content, or reclaim usernames if we reasonably believe you’ve violated these Terms, pose a risk, or for operational/legal reasons. Upon termination, sections intended to survive (e.g., licenses for operating copies already made, disclaimers, limitations, governing law) will continue to apply.</p>

  <h2>14) Disclaimers</h2>
  <p class="small">THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON‑INFRINGEMENT. We do not guarantee that rankings, notifications, or any content will be available, accurate, or error‑free.</p>

  <h2>15) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p class="small">TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SANDOOK LLC AND ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM WILL NOT EXCEED $100 OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM—WHICHEVER IS GREATER. Some jurisdictions don’t allow certain limits; those limits apply to the fullest extent permitted.</p>

  <h2>16) Indemnity</h2>
  <p class="small">You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Sandook LLC from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your content, your use of the Service, or your violation of these Terms or applicable law.</p>

  <h2>17) Governing law, venue</h2>
  <p class="small">These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Oregon and the United States, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws rules. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Washington County, Oregon for any dispute not subject to arbitration.</p>

  <h2>18) Export and sanctions</h2>
  <p class="small">You may not use the Service if you are located in a jurisdiction embargoed by the United States or if you are on a U.S. government restricted list.</p>
