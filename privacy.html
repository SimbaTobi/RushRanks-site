        <li><strong>Account</strong>: your email address.</li>
        <li><strong>Location (state only)</strong>: we store the U.S. state you live in so your uploads compete on the correct state leaderboard. We do not store precise GPS coordinates.</li>
        <li><strong>Content & activity</strong>: videos you upload (“Rushes”), likes you give/receive, and basic timestamps.</li>
        <li><strong>Reports & moderation</strong>: content you report and moderation decisions, including automated visual moderation results.</li>
