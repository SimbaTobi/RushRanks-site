  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="small">Last updated: 2025-10-14</p>

  <p>RushRanks is a product of <strong>Sandook LLC</strong> (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the RushRanks mobile apps and website.</p>

  <h2>Who can use RushRanks</h2>
  <p class="small">RushRanks is available only in the United States to individuals 13 years or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

  <h2>Information we collect</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Account</strong>: your <strong>first and last name</strong> and your <strong>email address</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>Location (state only)</strong>: the U.S. <strong>state</strong> where you live, so your uploads compete on the correct state leaderboard. We do <strong>not</strong> store precise GPS.</li>
    <li><strong>Content &amp; activity</strong>: videos you upload (“<strong>Rushes</strong>”), likes you give/receive, basic timestamps, and information related to moderation (including community reports).</li>
    <li><strong>Push notifications</strong>: device push tokens (APNs/FCM) and basic event data (e.g., likes/messages) to deliver notifications. You can control notifications in device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Ads &amp; identifiers (AdMob)</strong>: advertising/device identifiers, coarse device/network info, and app usage signals used to show and measure ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Technical &amp; diagnostic logs</strong>: limited technical logs and crash/diagnostic data to keep the app reliable and secure.</li>
    <li><strong>Website technologies</strong>: essential cookies or similar tech for security and functionality. We do <strong>not</strong> use ad trackers on the website.</li>
    <li><strong>Support</strong>: messages you send to <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="small"><strong>IP addresses.</strong> We and our service providers may process IP addresses automatically for security, fraud prevention, and basic geolocation.</p>
  <p class="small"><strong>Automated visual moderation.</strong> We use automated tools (e.g., AWS visual moderation) plus human review to help detect unsafe/inappropriate content. We do <strong>not</strong> use facial recognition for identity.</p>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li>Provide and improve the Service (run state leaderboards, process uploads/likes, deliver notifications).</li>
    <li>Determine ranks: RushRanks uses a <strong>likes-only</strong> system.</li>
    <li>Moderate content and enforce our Terms (automated tools + human review).</li>
    <li>Show and measure ads via <strong>AdMob</strong>.</li>
    <li>Communicate with you about updates, safety, and support.</li>
    <li>Protect users and the Service (security, fraud prevention) and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    <li>We report apparent child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and/or law enforcement as required by U.S. law (18 U.S.C. §2258A).</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="small"><em>Legal bases (best‑practice disclosure):</em> with your consent (e.g., account, notifications), to perform the Service you request, and as necessary for safety, security, legal compliance, and our legitimate interests.</p>

  <h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
  <p class="small">We show ads using AdMob. AdMob may receive device/advertising identifiers, app usage, and contextual data to show, cap, and measure ads. We do not offer in‑app purchases at launch.</p>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> limit ad tracking in your device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>California notice:</strong> we do not sell personal information. Ad identifiers may be considered “sharing for cross‑context behavioral advertising.” Californians can request to opt out by emailing <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a> and using device ad‑privacy settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Social links &amp; comments</h2>
  <p class="small"><strong>Social profiles:</strong> you can link TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube on your profile. We display links you provide; we do not pull data from those services unless you explicitly share it.</p>
  <p class="small"><strong>Comments (future):</strong> if comments launch, we will process comment text and metadata for display and moderation under this Policy.</p>

  <h2>How we share information</h2>
  <p class="small">We share data only with service providers that help us operate RushRanks—for example: hosting/storage and video processing, content delivery/security (CDN), push notifications (APNs/FCM), ads (AdMob), moderation tooling (e.g., AWS), email/support, crash reporting/diagnostics. These providers act under contracts limiting their use of your information. We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights/safety, or to investigate abuse. We do <strong>not sell</strong> personal information.</p>

  <h2>Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Access / deletion:</strong> email <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a>. Deleting an account removes your profile and uploads; certain records (e.g., moderation/safety logs) may be retained as permitted or required by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> control push notifications in device settings.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad preferences:</strong> use device settings to limit ad personalization or reset your advertising ID.</li>
    <li><strong>State privacy rights (e.g., CA/VA/CO/CT/UT):</strong> depending on your state, you may have rights to access, delete, correct, or obtain a portable copy of your information, and to opt out of “sharing” for cross‑context behavioral advertising. Contact us to exercise rights. We will not discriminate for exercising your rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data retention</h2>
  <ul class="small">
    <li><strong>Account (name, email) &amp; state:</strong> kept while your account is active (and a reasonable period afterward for safety/legal requirements).</li>
    <li><strong>Content/likes, notifications metadata &amp; moderation/crash logs:</strong> retained as long as needed for reliability, safety, abuse prevention, and legal compliance.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="small">We apply retention limits and delete or de‑identify data when no longer needed.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p class="small">We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data we handle. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>Transfers &amp; location of processing</h2>
  <p class="small">We primarily process and store information in the United States. Some providers may process data in other locations with appropriate protections.</p>

  <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
  <p class="small">We do not respond to Do Not Track signals. Use device ad‑privacy settings to limit ad personalization.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p class="small">If we make material changes, we will notify you by reasonable means (e.g., in‑app notice or email) and update the “Last updated” date.</p>
