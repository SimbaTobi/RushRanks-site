    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: <time datetime="2025-10-14">October 14, 2025</time></p>

    <p>RushRanks is a product of <strong>Sandook LLC</strong> (“we,” “us,” “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the RushRanks mobile apps and website.</p>

    <h2>Who can use RushRanks</h2>
    <p>RushRanks is available only in the United States to individuals <strong>13 years or older</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account:</strong> your first and last name and your email address.</li>
      <li><strong>Location (state only):</strong> your U.S. state to place uploads on the correct leaderboard; <strong>we do not store precise GPS</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Content &amp; activity:</strong> videos (“Rushes”), likes, rankings, basic timestamps, follow relationships, and moderation metadata (including community reports).</li>
      <li><strong>Push notifications:</strong> device push tokens (APNs/FCM) and minimal event data (e.g., likes/messages) to deliver notifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Ads &amp; identifiers (AdMob):</strong> advertising/device identifiers, coarse device/network info, and app usage signals used to show and measure ads.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical &amp; diagnostic logs:</strong> limited technical logs and optional crash/diagnostic data to keep the app reliable and secure.</li>
      <li><strong>Website technologies:</strong> essential cookies or similar technologies for security and functionality; no ad trackers on the website.</li>
      <li><strong>Support:</strong> messages you send to <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>IP addresses:</strong> we and our providers may process IP addresses for security, fraud prevention, abuse detection, and basic geolocation.</li>
      <li><strong>Automated visual moderation:</strong> automated tools (e.g., AWS Rekognition) plus human review help detect unsafe/inappropriate content; we do not use facial recognition to identify people.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we use information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Operate and improve the Service (process uploads/likes, run state leaderboards, deliver notifications).</li>
      <li>Determine ranks via a <strong>likes-only</strong> system and preserve the integrity of daily cycles.</li>
      <li>Safety &amp; moderation (automated tools + human review), including enforcement actions.</li>
      <li>Show and measure ads via <strong>AdMob</strong>.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you about updates, safety, and support.</li>
      <li>Protect users and the Service (security, fraud prevention) and comply with legal obligations.</li>
      <li><strong>CSAE reporting:</strong> we report apparent child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to <strong>NCMEC</strong> and/or law enforcement as required by U.S. law (<strong>18 U.S.C. §2258A</strong>).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising (AdMob)</h2>
    <p>We show ads using AdMob. AdMob may receive device/advertising identifiers, app usage, and contextual data to show, cap, and measure ads. We do not offer in-app purchases at launch.</p>
    <p><strong>Personalized ads:</strong> limit ad tracking in your device settings. <strong>California:</strong> we do not sell personal information. Ad identifiers may be considered “sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising.” Californians may opt out by emailing <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a> and using device ad-privacy settings.</p>

    <h2>Social links &amp; comments</h2>
    <p><strong>Social profiles:</strong> you can link TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube on your profile. We display links you provide and do not pull data unless you explicitly share it. <strong>Comments (future):</strong> if launched, we process comment text/metadata for display and moderation.</p>

    <h2>How we share information</h2>
    <p>We share data only with service providers that help us operate RushRanks—for example: hosting/storage and video processing, content delivery/security (CDN), push (APNs/FCM), ads (AdMob), moderation tooling (e.g., AWS), email/support, crash reporting/diagnostics. These providers act under contracts limiting their use of your information. We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights/safety, or to investigate abuse. We do not sell personal information.</p>

    <h2>Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Access / deletion:</strong> email <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a>. Deleting an account removes your profile and uploads; certain records (e.g., moderation/safety logs) may be retained as permitted or required by law.</li>
      <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> control push notifications in device and in-app settings (where available).</li>
      <li><strong>Ad preferences:</strong> use device settings to limit ad personalization or reset your advertising ID.</li>
      <li><strong>State privacy rights (CA/VA/CO/CT/UT):</strong> depending on your state, you may have rights to access, delete, correct, obtain a portable copy, and opt out of “sharing” for cross-context behavioral advertising. Contact us to exercise rights. We will not discriminate for exercising your rights.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>Account (name, email) &amp; state: kept while your account is active and for a reasonable period afterward for safety/legal requirements. Content/likes, notification metadata, and moderation/crash logs: retained as long as needed for reliability, safety, abuse prevention, and legal compliance, then deleted or de-identified.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data we handle. No method is 100% secure. Report suspected vulnerabilities to <a href="mailto:support@rushranks.com">support@rushranks.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Transfers &amp; location of processing</h2>
    <p>We primarily process and store information in the United States. Some providers may process data in other locations with appropriate protections.</p>

    <h2>Do Not Track</h2>
    <p>We do not respond to Do Not Track signals. Use device ad-privacy settings to limit ad personalization.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>If we make material changes, we will notify you by reasonable means (e.g., in-app notice or email) and update the “Last updated” date.</p>
